# AGENTS.md

## CRITICAL: Load `mastra` skill first

Load the `mastra` skill BEFORE any Mastra work. Never rely on cached knowledge — APIs change between versions.

## Rules

- Register all agents, tools, workflows, and scorers in `src/mastra/index.ts`
- Use the `dev` and `build` scripts from `package.json` instead of running `mastra dev` / `mastra build` directly

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues in `mahmoodsabir/Taktra`, managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, each label string equal to its name. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
